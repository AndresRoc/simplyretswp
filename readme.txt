Show your Real Estate listings on your Wordpress site. A very simple set up and full control over your listings. Official Simply Rets plugin.

== Description ==

The Simply Rets plugin lets you integrate your Real Estate listings directly on your Wordpress site with little to no hassle.
This plugin requires a plan with [Simply Rets](http://simplyrets.com), but demo listing data is provided for you to test out and
make sure the plugin does what you're looking for. Getting started with the Simply Rets plugin is as easy as installing it and
making a new page!

In order to get *your* properties on your site, there are only a couple of things you need:
* You must be a current member of an MLS provider. This is who we get your properties from (which we'll take care of).
* You must have an active plan with [Simply Rets](http://simplyrets.com). We offer a wide variety of plans to accomodate most
situations. Visit our website for me details on pricing and how to get started.


The Simply Rets plugin generates accurate HTML and does *not* use iFrames or ever take your visitors away from your site - which
we've learned is essential for materializing online leads. The power is put back in your hands by giving you full control of which
of your listings to show, and on which pages.

The plugin also provides you extensions on many standard wordpress features:
* A custom 'Rets Listings' page type for creating pages with listing results.
* Sidebar and footer widgets for Features Listings, Search, etc.
* Plenty of shortcodes for splicing your listings into any page or post.
* Filters for searches, custom pages, etc.

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
